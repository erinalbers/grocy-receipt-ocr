# Grocy Receipt OCR

A tool to automatically process grocery receipts, extract product information using OCR, and add items to your Grocy inventory system.

## Features

- **Receipt OCR**: Extract product information from receipt images or PDFs
- **Grocy Integration**: Check products against your Grocy database
- **Barcode Matching**: Identify products by barcode number
- **Smart Product Creation**: Generate links to create missing products in Grocy
- **Category Mapping**: Map store categories to Grocy product categories
- **Purchase Automation**: Pre-populate purchase entries with prices from receipts

## How It Works

1. Upload a receipt image or PDF
2. The system OCRs the receipt to extract product information
3. Products are checked against your Grocy database by barcode
4. For products not found in the database:
   - A link is provided to create the item
   - Store categories are mapped to Grocy categories when possible
5. After all products are added (or marked to skip), you'll be directed to a page with:
   - Links to the "purchase" APIs for each product
   - Pre-populated prices from the receipt

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Grocy instance with API access
- Receipt files (images or PDFs)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/erinalbers/grocy-receipt-ocr.git
   cd grocy-receipt-ocr
   ```

2. Configure your environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   GROCY_API_URL=https://your-grocy-instance/api
   GROCY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. Copy the Category Mappings:
   ```
   cp config/category_mappings.example.json config/category_mappings.json
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration

### Category Mapping

You can configure store-specific category mappings in the `config/category_mappings.json` file:

```json
{
  "Safeway": {
    "REFRIG/FROZEN": "Refrigerated Foods",
    "PRODUCE": "Fruits & Vegetables",
    "MEAT": "Meat"
  }
}
```
### Custom Processors

You can also add your own custom receipt processors - regular expressions that identify the values in a line in the receipt.
Create a new file at config/receipt_processors.json, using the file receipt_processors_default.json as an example.

`nano config/receipt_processors.json`

The processor will look for the search string in the receipt, and if it is able to match that string it will test each of the processors. If it finds one that works, it will stop processing and return the product results.

The search string can be any value, for example, the phone number of your favorite store.

If you specify that the receipt has category markers the category_mappings.json file will be checked and category matches will be attempted.

```json
{
   "name":"Safeway",
   "search_string":"SAFEWAY",
   "has_categories": true,
   "processors": [
      "^(?P<barcode>\\d+)\\s*(?P<title>.*)\\s+(?P<full_price>\\d+[\\.,]+\\d{2})\\s+(?P<price>\\d+[\\.,]+\\d{2})\\s*[5S$]*$"
   ]
}
```

## Usage

1. Upload a receipt through the web interface
2. Review the extracted products
3. For each product not found in Grocy:
   - Click "Create in Grocy" to add it to your database
   - Or map it to an existing product, saving the barcode for next time
   - Or click "Skip" to ignore this product
4. Once all products are processed, proceed to the purchase page
5. Review the pre-populated purchase entries
6. Click "Add Purchase" for each item you want to add to your inventory
